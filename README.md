## Background
At start of my second year of university was when we (as students) were allowed to resume in person classes, due to the pandemic. With the number of students in the class, a majoirtity of our lecutures we given in the lecture halls. Which meant we were sitting in lecture desks. The issue with lecture desks is there not enough room to take notes without bumping items off the desk. After the first few classes I came up with the following requierments: 
- Easily able to slide the device in/out of lecture desks.
- Not impede the abilty to note take on a 8.5x11 paper.
- Durable enough to last 3 years inside a backpack.
- Store a minimum of four pens and calculator when not in use.
- Allow for easy access to the calculator.

After acquiring some mesurments and a few sketches, the following design was created.

## Design:

The product was designed with wood as the build material, due to being inexpensive and durability. The pen table used 1/2 inch material for the layers as it allowed enough thickness to use brad nails. While 1/4 inch was used on the sides to keep the device thin.

An unintentional design was the angle given when the pen table was placed on top of the desk. Because of the angle the device could be used ontop of the table and a phone could be placed inside. To allow for viewing the lecture slides without requiring two hands. 


## Improvements:
The Pen Table was able to last for all remaining years of university. 
With that there are a few improvements I would recommend considering when building this product.
1) Adjustable bottom: One issue that I ran into half way through my third year was the lecture desks having different thickness. There was one hall that had desks that were different thicknesses then the others. A way to fix this would be to create a track and clamp system for the bottom and right side pieces
2) Adding a Cover: Small improvement would be to add a leather top to hold calculator in place when traveling.
